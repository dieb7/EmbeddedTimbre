Log for SFP
 This log is kept with the source code and is refined as the source code changes
 providing a human readable summary of the past, present and future of the code
 base. As issues are encountered, they are entered under the Issues: section. As
 they are resolved or things are changed, they are entered under the Updates:
 section. Once they are no longer relavent, they are removed. The repository will
 contain tags or major milestones which delineate these removals so as to serve
 as a signpost in the source code development preventing the accumulation of clutter.

Issues:
 1. should add structure to machines to allow for loop times to be stored. This would
 enable tracking hot machines or ones that might need attention. Generalize the name
 machine structure to include extra structures for such things like on the fly stats
 but it must be efficient to minimize overhead when collecting stats on the fly. Maybe
 this is a move towards structures for machines declared at compile time and then used
 at run time. Right now a machine cycle is monitored not individual machines. If machine
 queue had pointers to machine structurs, then it would be easy to add extra features.
 If they were executable structures then they could be intermixed with unnamed machines.

Updates:
